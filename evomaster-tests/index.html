      <h2>WARNING</h2>
      <p>
        If you see this message, it means the web app was not properly started.
        For example, if you opened the index.html file directly, that would be loaded with file:// protocol
        in your browser.
        By default, modern browsers block loading local files due to CORS issues.
        You need to open the web app via an HTTP server.
      </p>

      <p>
        To simplify the visualization of the web report, we provide a webreport.py script to start a HTTP server,
        and automatically open your browser on the starting page of the report.
        To simplify its use, we also provide a webreport.command (for Mac) and webreport.bat (for Windows) to easily start the
        Python script with a simple mouse double-click.
